Kingdom of Safari
=================

About
-----
This is a Safari extension designed to customize the user experience of [The Kingdom of Loathing][kol].


Installation
------------
1. Go to the [downloads section][downloads] and grab the latest version of this extension.

2. Double-click the file you just downloaded. Safari should offer to install it for you.


Features
--------
* Includes a fully-functional version of Chez's [ActiveChat][ac].

* Adds additional keyboard shortcuts to chat:

    `.` — Typing a period will grant focus to the chat field.
    
    `/` — Typing a forward slash will grant focus to the chat field and enter a slash into the field. This enables the player to just start typing chat commands even if the chat field does not currently have focus.
    
    `CTRL-D` — Hitting Control-D when the chat field is active will cause the chat field to lose focus and instead grant focus to the main content pane, allowing the player to immediately continue adventuring.

* Fixes a KoL focus bug in Safari, which prevented players from using the keyboard to progress through an adventure without clicking on the content frame after each and every page load.


Thanks
------
Special thanks go out to:

* CDMoyer — For everything that he does, including his [tabbed chat script][cdmtc], which was the inspiration for [ActiveChat][ac].

* Chez — For his amazing [ActiveChat][ac] script. This was the script that made me wish that Safari had better support for Greasemonkey scripts.
